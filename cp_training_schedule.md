## 📚 Important Notes
### What is Upsolving?
Upsolving is the process of solving problems that you couldn't solve during a contest or practice session. It involves:
- Revisiting problems you couldn't solve
- Reading editorials and understanding solutions
- Implementing the correct solution
- Learning from mistakes and alternative approaches

### General Tips:
1. **Time Management:**
   - Stick to time limits strictly
   - If stuck for >20 minutes, move to next problem
   - Mark unsolved problems for upsolving

2. **Problem Selection:**
   - Choose problems you haven't solved before
   - Focus on your weak areas
   - Balance between comfort and challenge

3. **Learning Process:**
   - Document new algorithms learned
   - Note down common patterns
   - Review mistakes and alternative solutions
