## 📚 Training Guidelines

### 1. What is Upsolving?
Upsolving is the process of solving problems that you couldn't solve during a contest or practice session. It involves:
- Revisiting problems you couldn't solve
- Reading editorials and understanding solutions
- Implementing the correct solution
- Learning from mistakes and alternative approaches

### 2. General Tips
#### Time Management:
- Stick to time limits strictly
- If stuck for >20 minutes, move to next problem
- Mark unsolved problems for upsolving
- Use a timer for each problem

#### Problem Selection:
- Choose problems you haven't solved before
- Focus on your weak areas
- Balance between comfort and challenge
- Track solved problems to avoid repetition

#### Learning Process:
- Document new algorithms learned
- Note down common patterns
- Review mistakes and alternative solutions
- Create a personal problem-solving template

### 3. Problem-Solving Framework
1. **Understand the Problem**
   - Read carefully
   - Identify constraints
   - Note sample inputs/outputs
   - Time: 2-3 minutes

2. **Plan the Solution**
   - Think of brute force first
   - Identify patterns
   - Consider edge cases
   - Time: 5-7 minutes

3. **Implement**
   - Write clean, modular code
   - Add comments
   - Test with samples
   - Time: 10-15 minutes

4. **Debug & Optimize**
   - Check edge cases
   - Optimize if needed
   - Time: 5 minutes
